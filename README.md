Welcome to my collection of C# Projects by JarvisMan11!

These are part of my school work, with plenty of passion and coding struggles included. Currently, I have a couple of projectsâ€”**Screensaver** and **DVD Project**â€”but Iâ€™ll be adding more as my coding journey continues.

---

### 1. Screensaver Project

A simple screensaver created using C#. It includes some basic animations that keep your screen from going to sleep while looking fun!

**Features:**
- Basic animations (or moving objects).
- Customizable settings (may or may not workâ€”your mileage may vary).
- Simple, lightweight, and educational.

### 2. DVD Project

A nostalgic DVD logo bouncing screensaver that simulates the iconic DVD logo bouncing off the edges of your screen. It's a throwback to the good old days!

**Features:**
- DVD logo bouncing off the screen edges.
- Customization options for logo size and position (if you've got the patience).
- Pure nostalgia in code form.

### Upcoming Projects
There will definitely be more projects soon. Stay tuned for things that might actually work (or crash unexpectedly).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JarvisMan11/.NET.


**Contributing**
If you'd like to contribute, you can fork the repo and create a pull request. However, don't expect me to merge it immediatelyâ€”I'm busy trying to pass this class.

If you spot any bugs, open an issue, but keep in mind Iâ€™m not going to fix them unless theyâ€™re breaking the whole program. ðŸ˜…

**Motivation**
The motivation behind these projects is simple: I need to pass this class, and creating a DVD screensaver seemed like a way to go. I hope these projects also teach me more about C# while making my professor think I know what Iâ€™m doing.

**License**
This project is licensed under the "Please Donâ€™t Fail Me" License. Feel free to use, modify, and contribute, but don't expect any promises of perfection or stability. Youâ€™re on your own, buddy! ðŸ˜‰
