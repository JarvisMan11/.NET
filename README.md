Welcome to my collection of C# Projects by JarvisMan11!

These are part of my school work, with plenty of passion and coding struggles included. Currently, I have a couple of projects—**Screensaver** and **DVD Project**—but I’ll be adding more as my coding journey continues.

### 1. Screensaver Project

A simple screensaver created using C#. It includes some basic animations that keep your screen from going to sleep while looking fun!

**Features:**
- Basic animations (or moving objects).
- Customizable settings (may or may not work—your mileage may vary).
- Simple, lightweight, and educational.

### 2. DVD Project

A nostalgic DVD logo bouncing screensaver that simulates the iconic DVD logo bouncing off the edges of your screen. It's a throwback to the good old days!

**Features:**
- DVD logo bouncing off the screen edges.
- Customization options for logo size and position (if you've got the patience).
- Pure nostalgia in code form.

### Upcoming Projects
There will definitely be more projects soon. Stay tuned for things that might actually work (or crash unexpectedly).
