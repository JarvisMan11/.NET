Welcome to my collection of C# Projects by JarvisMan11!

These are part of my school work, with plenty of passion and coding struggles included. Currently, I have a couple of projects—**Screensaver** and **DVD Project**—but I’ll be adding more as my coding journey continues.

---

### 1. Screensaver Project

A simple screensaver created using C#. It includes some basic animations that keep your screen from going to sleep while looking fun!

**Features:**
- Basic animations (or moving objects).
- Customizable settings (may or may not work—your mileage may vary).
- Simple, lightweight, and educational.

### 2. DVD Project

A nostalgic DVD logo bouncing screensaver that simulates the iconic DVD logo bouncing off the edges of your screen. It's a throwback to the good old days!

**Features:**
- DVD logo bouncing off the screen edges.
- Customization options for logo size and position (if you've got the patience).
- Pure nostalgia in code form.

### Upcoming Projects
There will definitely be more projects soon. Stay tuned for things that might actually work (or crash unexpectedly).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JarvisMan11/.NET.git


## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute, you can fork the repo and create a pull request. However, don't expect me to merge it immediately—I'm busy trying to pass this class.

If you spot any bugs, open an issue, but keep in mind I’m not going to fix them unless they’re breaking the whole program. 😅

## Motivation
These projects are part of my school assignments, and while I don't get to pick them, I'm still trying to make the best of it! The goal is simple: **pass the class** while learning C# and improving my coding skills. So far, it's been a mix of fun and panic as deadlines approach. 🤯

Whether it's creating a bouncing DVD logo screensaver or a fancy screensaver, I’m learning something new with every project (and praying it works when it’s time to submit). 😅
